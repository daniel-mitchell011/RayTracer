This is a straight-forward implementation of the code found in the Ray Tracing series using Rust instead of C++ -- all three volumes may be found [here](https://raytracing.github.io/)).

This implementation uses the Rust [image library](https://docs.rs/image/latest/image/) so that PNGs can be used out of the box (instead of the PPM files that are initially used in the first book).

Current project status: Just Started; don't expect much yet.
